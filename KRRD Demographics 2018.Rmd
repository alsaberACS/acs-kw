## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r KRRD_ALL}
library(readr)
KRRD_ALL <- read_delim("KRRD ALL.csv", "\t", 
    escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

subset(KRRD_ALL, select=c("Hospital","Gender","Nationality","BMI"))
library(epiDisplay)
library(summarytools)
tab1(KRRD_ALL$Gender, sort.group = "decreasing", cum.percent = TRUE)
summarytools::freq(KRRD_ALL$Gender, sort.group = "decreasing", order = "freq")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
